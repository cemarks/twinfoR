\usage{
authorize_IT()
}
\value{
On successful authentication, a character vector containing the following named character strings:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{consumer.token} \tab The Twitter Application Consumer Token \cr
\code{consumer.secret} \tab The Twitter Application Consumer Secret \cr
\code{access.token} \tab The User's Access Token for the Twitter Application \cr
\code{access.secret} \tab The User's Access Secret for the Twitter Application.
}
On authentication failure, a warning is thrown and the failed http response object
is returned.

\description{
Authorize the INFORMS-Tutorial Twitter application for a user.
}
\details{
This is the easiest way to get started collecting and analyzing Twitter data.
All that is needed is a Twitter user account.
The application consumer token and consumer secret for the
INFORMS-Tutorial Application are provided in this package.
This function supplies these to the Twitter API to authorize this
*read only* application to query the Twitter API on the user's behalf.
See \href{http://zlisto.scripts.mit.edu/informs_tutorial/tutorial.html}{2015 INFORMS Twitter Mining Tutorial}
for more information about the origin of this Application.  This function
will require the user to log in to Twitter and authorize this application.
Once authorized, Twitter will provide the User with a PIN that must be entered
into R.  Using this PIN, R will complete the authentication process and return
the user's authentication credentials (access token and secret), which the user
can save locally for future use.
}
\section{Authentication Keys}{

The application consumer secret and user token secret are authentication passcodes
that should not be shared.  In particular, the INFORMS-Tutorial consumer secret, while
provided as a part of this package, should not be shared or used outside of
the scope of mining Twitter data for the purposes of research and analyses that
conform to applicable laws and policies, including Twitter's terms of use.
}

\section{Note}{

It is easy to hit <ENTER> in the console after calling this function before
entering your PIN, especially when copying and pasting code; this will
result in an authentication failure. To avoid this 
mistake, enter the \code{authorize_app} line manually into the console.  Then,
log on to Twitter and browse to the URL provided (if this does not happen automatically),
authorize the app in the browser, retrieve the PIN, and enter the PIN back into the
R Console.
